# PROJECT 1
There was no issues whatsoever, everything compiled, the new kernel version was succesfully updated.
All of the commands, including installing dependencies, went smooth.
All of "make" commands worked great although "make -j4" took more than 2 hours for me to run.
I had a hard time configuring the read only file for grub but used the hard boot to choose the grub bootable option from grub menu.
I only took screenshots of wht I thought was most important: 
  - Grub menu
  - "uname -a" output
  - "ls" to show all the files in the direectory of the extracted kernel file
  - "make" output to show that the "make -j4" installation was succesful
